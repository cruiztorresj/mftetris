Mobile First Tetris

More than a year ago I subscribed to educative for a week (Yes, the seven-day trial version) and I ended following [this tutorial](https://www.educative.io/courses/game-development-js-tetris) on how to implement Tetris in the web browser.

[This](https://github.com/melcor76/js-tetris) is the official repository for the aforementioned training, of course there have been some aditions to the code.

Still, these days I wanted to take the code resulted from following the tutorial and add some sort of support for mobile devices, supporting touch screen gestures. As a learning experience and experimentation with JavaScript.

You may be wondering why I don't make a pull request with the results to the official repository, the reason is that I don't know what the end result will be. And I don't want to mess the things they already have in place.

I will be updating this documentation as I make progress in such endeavor.
